// merge two sorted arrays
// GAP method
//Initially take the gap as (m+n)/2;
// Take as a pointer1 = 0 and pointer2 = gap.
// Run a oop from pointer1 &  pointer2 to  m+n and whenever arr[pointer2]<arr[pointer1], just swap those.
// After completion of the loop reduce the gap as gap=gap/2.
// Repeat the process until gap>0.
