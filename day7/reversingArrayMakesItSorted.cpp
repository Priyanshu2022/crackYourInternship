// Check if reversing a sub array make the array sorted
// 1st -> N*N
// 2nd -> NlogN 
// The idea is to compare the given array with the sorted array. Make a copy of the given array and sort it. Now, find // the first index and last index which do not match with sorted array. If no such indices are found, print “Yes”. 
// Else check if the elements between the indices are in decreasing order.
// 3rd -> 1st array should be increasing , then decreasing , then increasing
